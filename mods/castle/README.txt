This is a mod all about creating castles and castle dungeons. Many of the nodes are used for the outer-walls or dungeons.

Contains as of now:

--Walls, Corner-walls,
--Castlestone Stairs, Slabs, and Pillars
--Jailbars
--Hides
--Arrowslits
--Rubble (for between walls)
--Doors
--and more!

Although crossbows have been removed, along with arrows, the code is still there.
To get the crossbows back, look in init.lua. You will see at the top some lines 
with dofile in them. Copy and paste two more of these lines, and change them to
crossbow.lua and arrow.lua to get them back.

I HAVE found the bug that caused me to remove them, and it will be fixed within 
the week. I will then re-add crossbows.
